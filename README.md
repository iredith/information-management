# Student-recruitment-information-management
A webapp created in django for comprehensive student information system and user
interface is to replace the current paper records. College Staff are able to directly access all
aspects of a student’s academic progress through a secure, online interface embedded in the
college’s website. The system utilizes user authentication, displaying only information
necessary for an individual’s duties. Additionally, each sub-system has authentication
allowing authorized users to create or update information in that subsystem. All data is
thoroughly reviewed and validated on the server before actual record alteration occurs. In
addition to a staff user interface, the system plans for student user interface, allowing users to
access information and submit requests online thus reducing processing time. All data is
stored securely on SQLite servers managed by the college administrator and ensures highest
possible level of security. The system features a complex logging system to track all users
access and ensure conformity to data access guidelines and is expected to increase the
efficiency of the college’s record management thereby decreasing the work hours needed to
access and deliver student records to users.
Student Recruiting Information Management System (SIMS) provides a simple interface for
maintenance of student information. It can be used by educational institutes or colleges to
maintain the records of students easily. The creation and management of accurate, up-to-date
information regarding a students’ academic career is critically important in the university as

related reports, college details, course details, curriculum, batch details, placement details
